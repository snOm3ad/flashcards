# Flashcards

*Flashcards* is a web-application written in react with a golang backend. I wrote this with the purpose of helping me memorize boring questions for my courses at university.

## How does it work?
It's simple, a flashcard consists of two things

- Question
- Answer

Each question has an associated maximum score which decreases the longer you take to answer a question, and a maximum amount of time it should take you to answer that question. *Flashcards* will start a countdown as soon as you're able to see the question. Once you have seen the answer to the question, you tell *Flashcards* if you got it right or not. If you did, then you get an adjusted score based on how much time it took you to answer it, if you didn't answer right then it gives you no points.

## TODO

Pretty much **everything**. Right now is a minimal working example, I am near exam season right now so I am trying to work on it as fast as I can to get it done in time.
